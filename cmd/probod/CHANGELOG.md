# Changelog

All notable changes to `probod` (the server, including the bundled `@probo/console`, `@probo/compliance-portal`, and `@probo/ui` frontends) will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- HubSpot access-review connector now marks deactivated/archived users as inactive by consulting the Owners API (`archived=true`) instead of treating every Settings Users row as active

## [0.241.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- MCP tools now carry titles and complete annotation hints (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) so clients like Claude present reads, writes, and deletes accurately

### Changed

- Member profiles now have a `PENDING` state distinct from `ACTIVE`/`DEACTIVATED`, so invited-but-not-yet-activated members remain assignable to assets, data, and risks; owner pickers and state filters across the console, CLI, MCP, and n8n now accept multiple states
- "Archive" user action renamed to "Deactivate" across the API, CLI, MCP, n8n, and console
- People list status filter is now a multi-select dropdown instead of cramped checkboxes, and reflects `PENDING` immediately after an activation email is sent
- Audit log and SCIM export CSV files now escape leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, and carriage-return characters to prevent spreadsheet formula injection

### Fixed

- Asset table's inline owner picker no longer offers deactivated profiles as owners
- People list search no longer briefly reverts to stale results when a debounced search resolves after a filter change
- Disabled dropdown checkbox items are now fully non-interactive (opacity, cursor, hover) instead of only dimming the checkbox glyph

## [0.240.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Log export for audit logs and SCIM events: request a CSV export job from the console, Connect, MCP, or CLI, streamed and uploaded to S3 by a concurrent export worker
- Auth cookie `SameSite` attribute is now configurable (`PROBOD_AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE`, defaults to `Lax`), rejecting `None` unless `Secure` is enabled
- In-tab light/dark display mode toggle for signed-in compliance portal guests, independent of the OS color scheme
- Subprocessor cards truncate long country/region lists behind a "+N" popover

### Changed

- Access review campaigns can now be deleted in any status, except while a campaign is still fetching sources
- Document share action relabeled "Copy link" and exposed on each row of the documents list, not just the viewer
- Locked document viewer keeps showing the document title and an access-request CTA instead of withholding the whole page
- Guest language selector shows the locale code instead of the full language name to save space next to "Get access"
- Compliance portal TopBar stacks the brand name over the tagline and shortens nav labels on narrower viewports
- html2pdf-rendered PDFs (e.g. signature certificates) now request a tagged structure tree and document outline from Chrome for accessibility
- `safeRedirect` now accepts configured CORS origins as valid continue-URL hosts, alongside verified custom domains

### Fixed

- Document soft-delete now clears associated control/risk/measure mappings, fixing risk deletion when the linked document was already removed
- Console document `lang` attribute now follows the active i18next locale instead of always reporting English
- "Trusted by" logo tiles now stretch to match row height when a caption wraps to two lines
- Compliance portal drawer's dropdown/select menus are clickable again when the swipe drawer's transform was blocking pointer events underneath it
- Ukrainian "+N more regions" label now uses the correct one/few/many plural forms

## [0.239.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Device page shows a formatted value per posture check alongside current postures; the Postures tab is replaced with paginated report history grouped by agent push time

## [0.238.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Optional `auditStartDate`/`auditEndDate` on audits, exposed through GraphQL, MCP, CLI, n8n, and console, with new sortable order fields `AUDIT_START_DATE`/`AUDIT_END_DATE`

### Fixed

- Unverified password identities could open a session after signing out; password sign-in is now rejected with `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` until the address is confirmed, with a resend-confirmation email flow
- Completing a magic link for an existing identity now marks the address verified, matching OIDC behavior
- Mermaid diagrams that fail to render now show a toast with a safe inline fallback instead of leaking raw Mermaid error markup into documents

## [0.237.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Compliance portal documents page supports bulk requesting access: select several locked documents, reports, or files and request access to all of them in one call
- `updateAccessReviewCampaign` now accepts `accessReviewSourceIds` to sync a campaign's scope sources alongside other updates in the same call
- People list gained search and status/role/type filters across GraphQL, MCP, and CLI, with the default page size raised to 100
- Third-party selector fields on measures and other forms now show only first-level third parties

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash on the third-party detail page when a third party's country was set to the global pseudo-region
- Empty toast viewport no longer blocks pointer events (hover/click) over content underneath it, such as bottom action bar buttons

### Security

- Bumped `postcss` to 8.5.23 and `react-router` to 8.3.0 to remediate high-severity npm audit findings

## [0.236.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Five new access-review connectors: Google Analytics (GA4), Dotfile, Segment, Square, and UpCloud, with account listing, role/status resolution, and connector logos
- French translation for the console and compliance portal, backed by a new `react-i18next` setup
- Documentation links for the Dotfile, Segment, and 19 other API-key access-review connectors' setup dialogs
- Restored the "Risk Accepted" status on finding create/update forms, with a searchable paginated risk picker to supply the required linked risk

### Fixed

- Preserve the post-login destination through OIDC, magic-link, and SAML auth-error redirects instead of dropping it on `/auth/error`
- Custom-domain CNAME verification no longer fails on multi-hop DNS alias chains
- 1Password and Langfuse access-review connectors could not be connected: required extra settings (SCIM bridge URL, base URL) were silently dropped by the console

## [0.235.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Device management: enroll employee devices via the new `probo-agent`, view posture and admin the device fleet with owner assignment from the console, and let employees confirm enrollment and check their own device status without an assumed session
- "Documentation" links for connector setup: the API-key connect dialog and access-review Add Source dialog now link to a connector's docs page when available

### Changed

- Renamed the "My Signatures" console menu item to "Employee Portal"
- Auth failures (SAML, OIDC, magic-link) now redirect to a shared `/auth/error` page with a stable error code and a clear explanation instead of raw JSON or one-off pages; SAML failures always show a generic reason to avoid leaking account or org state

### Fixed

- Hardened custom-domain verification: CNAME/TXT checks now require the record owner to match the verified hostname, and CAA checks climb to the registrable domain and validate RFC 8659 syntax, closing a bypass where an apex record could satisfy verification for a subdomain
- Third-party category is no longer reset to "Other" when omitted from a partial update via MCP, GraphQL, or CLI

## [0.234.0] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Render longer vetting notes as markdown, keeping more of the orchestrator assessment text and skipping profile fields already on the third party

### Fixed

- Reject empty SAML NameIDs during assertion validation, preventing duplicate-key failures on later logins, and return a clear error when a NameID is already linked to another account
- Require portal redirect hosts to have a verified certificate (Active/Renewing) before allowing OIDC, magic-link, and compliance-portal OAuth `continue` redirects, closing an open redirect on newly claimed custom domains
- Fixed PostHog access-review sources being marked disconnected for EU cloud OAuth tokens by delegating region discovery to the shared resolver used by the access-review driver

## [0.233.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added pointer parallax to logo backdrops (`MediaTile`/`BackdropCard`), with eased entry and a frozen pose when the pointer leaves

### Fixed

- Split certificate provisioning into separate begin-challenge and poll-order workers so the global ACME rate-limit cooldown no longer blocks polling of in-flight orders
- Fixed several access-review connector defects that silently synced zero users or hammered vendor APIs (Sentry trailing-slash routing, Vercel OAuth team parameter, Brex company-read scope, Cloudflare `per_page` floor, picker providers now auto-select their first workspace, org defaulting now also applied via MCP, and the source-name worker no longer re-claims permanently-failed sources or loses a resolved name after reconnect)

### Removed

- Disabled the Clerk access-review connector: its Backend API only exposes application end-users, not workspace admins, so reviews targeted the wrong population

## [0.232.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Exposed a gauge for the ACME rate-limit cooldown end time (`certmanager_certificate_acme_cooldown_until_timestamp_seconds`) and expanded provisioning failure logs with the full ACME error detail (status code, instance, link, subproblems, retry-after), making cooldowns and CA errors diagnosable

## [0.231.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Compliance portal URLs are now locale-prefixed (e.g. `/fr/documents`), with self-canonical and hreflang SEO tags and a persisted identity locale that reconciles the browser locale against a saved preference via a mismatch banner

### Changed

- Compliance portal home page now shows a short entity name instead of the full portal title as its heading (API field renamed `title` -> `entityName`), restoring the localized hero composition and using the entity name as the OAuth client name

### Fixed

- Hardened automatic TLS certificate provisioning: fixed several race conditions and correctness gaps in the ACME worker (challenge acceptance ordering, write-back locking, Retry-After parsing, stale-order reset scoping, poll lease sizing, CAA error classification, and duplicate metrics registration) that could leave certificates stuck, unissued, or crash the provisioning worker

## [0.230.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Webhook events now include `RIGHT_REQUEST_CREATED`, `RIGHT_REQUEST_UPDATED`, and `RIGHT_REQUEST_DELETED` for rights requests created via console or compliance portal
- Compliance portal visitors can now sign in via OAuth/OIDC, with sign-in and consent screens showing the requesting client's branding (logo and name)
- Compliance portal home page now displays the full custom portal title as its heading, instead of composing it from the organization name
- Added a configurable trust center base domain (default `probopage.com`) so a managed default domain and certificate are provisioned for every compliance portal at organization creation

### Changed

- Renamed "Trust Center" to "Compliance Portal" across the GraphQL API and MCP tools — notably `ComplianceExternalURL` is now `ComplianceCustomLink` and the visibility field is `compliancePortalVisibility`
- Moved public-facing profile fields (title, description, website, email, headquarters address) off the organization and onto the compliance portal
- Custom domains and their certificates now belong to the compliance portal rather than the whole organization, with issuance and renewal handled by a dedicated poll-based worker
- Console: restructured the brand page into profile, domains, visual identity, and custom link sections, and moved frameworks and the NDA card onto the overview page

### Removed

- Removed the one-time session-transfer authentication flow for custom-domain SSO cookies, now that portal visitors authenticate via OAuth

## [0.229.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Mapped commitment and commitment group actions to the `v1:compliance-page` OAuth2 scope so tokens with that scope can create and manage commitments via MCP/API

## [0.229.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- MCP commitment and commitment group tools (create, list, update, delete) so automation can manage compliance portal commitments end to end

### Changed

- Redirect the legacy compliance portal `/overview` URL to home
- Introduced a v2 z-index scale so portaled menus and popups sit above in-page media

### Fixed

- Aligned the compliance portal PDF preview and desktop gutter with the page header, and matched list skeletons to the card surface

## [0.228.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- The compliance portal is now served in production for the `/trust` path and custom-domain sites, replacing the previous trust center frontend
- Added Data Requests pages to the compliance portal: data subjects can submit and track GDPR/CCPA rights requests (including rectification, objection, and complaint types) after magic-link sign-in, scoped to their verified email
- Added subscribe-to-updates in the compliance portal, with an Updates CTA and a sign-out action in the user menu
- Added eleven new compliance-portal locales: German, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese

### Changed

- Renamed the document approval button to "Approve" and updated the consent text to match, since the action only approves
- Made the compliance portal layout responsive
- Standardized copy to say "compliance portal" instead of "trust center" throughout

### Fixed

- Fixed document row accessibility for mobile screen readers and corrected PDF page sync after fit-to-width reflow
- Preserved `Field` `aria-describedby` when showing form errors

## [0.227.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added a Trust Center documents page with category grouping, a Public/Private visibility filter, and a full document viewer for PDFs, images, and other file downloads
- Added configurable, reorderable commitment cards to the compliance portal home page, replacing the hardcoded placeholder content
- Added a sign-in dialog (magic link + OIDC) that gates trust-center access requests

### Changed

- Renamed risk overview labels for consistency: "Severity" to "Score" and "Inherent" to "Initial"
- Archiving a document now voids pending approval quorums and cancels requested signatures instead of leaving them dangling

### Fixed

- Fixed an ambiguous tenant filter that caused signature load queries to fail

## [0.226.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Updated `golang.org/x/text` to v0.39.0 to remediate CVE-2026-56852

## [0.226.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added a v2 `ErrorBoundary` component (with companion `ErrorState` and `InlineError` primitives) to `@probo/ui` for graceful React error handling
- Webhook deliveries for `*:updated` events now include a top-level `updatedFrom` field alongside `data`, carrying a full snapshot of the entity as it was before the update (e.g. the prior membership role on `user:updated`). The field is omitted for non-update events

### Fixed

- SCIM user provisioning: deleting a user whose profile is still referenced (e.g. by signed document versions) now archives the user instead of returning a 500 and disabling the connector

## [0.225.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added managed access-review connectors for Scaleway, Yousign, Railway, and Crisp, including provider logos and website/ownership verification before a connection is established; managed connectors stay hidden until they are fully configured
- Added server-side filtering for trust center subprocessors, exposing facet-driven filters through the trust API
- Added trust center Updates list and detail pages with pagination and a mailing-list subscribe action
- Added a Risk Assessments tab to the risks list page in the console

### Changed

- The OAuth2 consent page now shows a submit loader and a redirect screen after the user grants consent

### Fixed

- Microsoft OIDC sign-in now requires verified domain ownership before linking an account

## [0.224.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Built with Go 1.26.5 (up from 1.26.4) to pick up the standard-library security fixes for CVE-2026-42505 (ECH handshake de-anonymization) and CVE-2026-39822 (`os.Root` symlink following on Unix)

## [0.224.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added FERPA and PCI DSS framework datasets (controls and logos), selectable in the framework import selector alongside the existing frameworks

### Changed

- Consolidated ownership-grant authorization into policy: granting OWNER (via `createUser` or `updateMembership`) is now restricted to organization owners through role-scoped allow policies conditioned on the assigned role, replacing the per-resolver custom checks and the now-removed `iam:membership-role:set-owner` action. The `permission` field gained an optional generic `attributes` key/value argument so the console can refine dry-run checks (e.g. by target role) without loosening the base grants
- Renamed the `DocumentVersionSignatureFilter` `state` field to `profileState` (GraphQL) / `profile_state` (MCP) to disambiguate it from the signature `states` field, since it filters on the signatory's profile state

### Fixed

- Enforced owner-only member removal: `removeUser` (API resolver and MCP `RemoveUserTool`) now requires the owner-only `iam:membership:delete` gate instead of the weaker `iam:membership-profile:delete`, so an organization ADMIN can no longer remove members (including OWNERs)
- Fixed a hole (GHSA-22xj-f767-ppw6) where a self-provisioned trust center visitor could accept or inject audit-trail events into another visitor's NDA signature by supplying its ID; esign now verifies signature ownership against the verified session identity in the accept and record-event flows
- Confined all public trust API reads and electronic-signature operations to the requesting compliance page's tenant, closing a cross-tenant access gap where a visitor could resolve nodes, export audit-report PDFs, and read or mutate signatures belonging to another organization
- Guarded the third-party vetting agent's HTTP tools against SSRF: outbound requests now route through an SSRF-protected client that rejects loopback, private, CGNAT, link-local, and reserved addresses on every redirect hop
- Excluded documents with no published version from the trust center "Grant All" available-access list so it matches the request-all filter and Slack notification
- Hid draft and hidden documents from the trust center access-request Slack notification so it only lists documents a requester could actually be granted
- Fixed Anthropic thinking budgets so `budget_tokens` stays below `max_tokens`; thinking is now omitted when the configured budget is too small to meet Anthropic's minimum

## [0.223.3] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Fixed IP address recording for NDA acceptance, document signing/approval events, and session creation behind a layer-7 proxy; affected endpoints now read the real client IP from `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-For` headers

## [0.223.2] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Fixed a privilege-escalation gap where an organization ADMIN could mint an OWNER membership through `createUser`, bypassing the owner-only authorization enforced elsewhere; `createUser` (both the API resolver and the MCP `CreateUserTool`) now requires set-owner authorization when the requested role is OWNER

## [0.223.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Fixed a cross-tenant IDOR where a Finding's linked Risk or a Processing Activity's Data Protection Officer could disclose another organization's data (GHSA-c74x-79w6-63jh): affected resolvers now authorize the referenced object itself instead of its parent, and the write paths validate the reference against the caller's organization

## [0.223.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Served files now support HTTP range requests, enabling seeking and resumable downloads
- Document lifecycle webhook events (`document.*`, including the `version`, `signature`, and `approval` sub-events) can now be subscribed to

### Changed

- Public files are served from a stable URL so CDN infrastructure can cache them properly
- Compliance report upload limit raised to 30MB
- OAuth token and consent UIs now display friendly names for the `v1:resource-alias` scopes instead of the raw scope string

### Fixed

- Compliance page no longer treats every Slack connector as connected
- Long Mermaid flowchart labels now wrap instead of being clipped in risk assessment diagrams
- Dialogs no longer close when dismissing a nested dropdown or select whose pointer lands inside the dialog, preserving form state

## [0.222.2] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- Bootstrap config output now omits empty fields and unset LLM provider blocks, producing cleaner generated YAML

## [0.222.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- String configuration defaults now come from `probod`'s built-in values when the corresponding environment variable is unset, ensuring bootstrap-generated and directly-configured deployments use the same defaults

## [0.222.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- OAuth2 loopback redirect URIs now match regardless of port, enabling native OAuth clients such as Claude Code that use ephemeral ports at authorization time (RFC 8252 section 7.3)
- Access review campaigns can now be closed when entries are in a failed state

### Changed

- Third-party risk assessment vetting notes now persist the full structured breakdown (risk classification, per-category analysis, privacy and data-processing practices, AI governance, contractual clauses, professional standing) instead of a short summary only

### Fixed

- Deleting a user still referenced elsewhere (e.g. as an asset owner) now returns a 409 Conflict instead of an internal error
- GraphQL endpoint is now protected against alias-flooding DoS (GHSA-prh2-g8pv-m7p9): parser token limit, field complexity cap, LRU query cache, and field suggestion suppression added to all three GraphQL handlers

### Removed

- Access review campaigns no longer expose a framework-controls field
- `pendingEntryCount` field removed from access review campaigns

## [0.221.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Compliance portal home page sections
- v2 UI component library: Text, Heading, Avatar, Button, IconButton, Badge, Callout, Dropdown menu, Card, Anchor, and Link components
- Webhook sender now runs on the kit worker framework

## [0.220.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Four new API-key access-review connectors: Pylon, OpenRouter, incident.io, and Brevo

### Fixed

- Advertised scopes for OAuth2 protected resources

## [0.219.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- DocuSign partner OAuth2 with PKCE: full authorization-code flow with account picker; the selected account is persisted and its data-center base URI resolved from /oauth/userinfo
- Five new API-key access-review connectors: Mercury, Apollo.io, Deepgram, ClickHouse Cloud, and Langfuse
- APIKeyBasicAuthUserPass auth mode for API-key connectors supporting username:password credentials
- Read actions on all unprefixed OAuth scopes

### Changed

- Pending signature requests on a superseded version are moved to the newly published minor version, preserving the notification schedule

### Fixed

- Signature requests are now restricted to the current published version
- Heroku connection probe sends the versioned `Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3` header, correctly detecting revoked tokens
- Third party assessment header display

## [0.218.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Bump `golang.org/x/image` to v0.43.0, remediating CVE-2026-33813 (denial of service via malformed WEBP parsing) and CVE-2026-46602 (missing tile-size limit in `x/image/tiff`)

## [0.218.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- RFC 6750 `WWW-Authenticate` challenges on OAuth bearer APIs (MCP, Console and Connect GraphQL, Files, OAuth2 userinfo): responses now advertise `resource_metadata`, `invalid_token`, and `insufficient_scope` with the required scopes

## [0.217.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Resource aliases: trust center entries support a custom URL slug; alias field and set/remove mutations exposed in the console API, trust API, and MCP tools, with alias-based navigation in the trust center

### Changed

- Agent tool JSON schemas normalize required fields for OpenAI compatibility

### Fixed

- Alias resolver, field blur, and sitemap URL generation

## [0.216.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- OAuth2 scope registration for CIMD client identifiers was missing; CIMD actions are now correctly gated by their corresponding scopes

## [0.216.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- OAuth2 Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD) support: MCP connectors such as ChatGPT and Claude can now register via HTTPS client_id URLs instead of pre-provisioned GIDs; metadata documents are fetched and cached, clients are upserted on first use, and CIMD is advertised in OIDC discovery when allowed URLs are configured

## [0.215.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Tracker-mapping no longer reprocesses sibling patterns O(N^2) times per banner; the re-enqueue now skips siblings already linked to a common third party or marked first-party, and routine mapping logs are demoted from INFO to Debug

## [0.215.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Tracker pattern category is now editable from the pattern detail page (matching the table-row behaviour)
- Trackers page filter now offers the HTTP cookie source, and extension-sourced rows render a proper source badge

### Changed

- Local storage, IndexedDB, and cache-storage trackers without an expiry now display as "persistent" rather than "session"

### Fixed

- Fixed a deadlock between concurrent tracker-mapping workers processing sibling patterns on the same banner
- An HTTP server-set cookie now outranks a pre-existing detection, re-arming mapping so the pattern is identified instead of being skipped

## [0.214.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- OAuth2 API scope enforcement: v1:* scopes registered and advertised in OIDC discovery and protected-resource metadata, enforced in the IAM authorizer before policy evaluation
- Identity-scoped OAuth token management: users can create, list, and revoke manual bearer tokens from `/me/oauth-tokens` and the console UI
- Auditor role now includes the `v1:iam:read` scope

### Changed

- OAuth consent screen groups API scopes under an accordion

### Fixed

- MCP API now accepts OAuth bearer tokens (was previously rejected)
- Notifications are skipped for inactive users

## [0.213.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Tracker-pattern catalog rows now carry a terminal attribution verdict (UNDETERMINED, THIRD_PARTY, FIRST_PARTY); FIRST_PARTY short-circuits the mapping pipeline so first-party and generic artifacts are never re-attributed

### Changed

- Document signing and approval emails are now batched per recipient by a debounced worker that sends one consolidated email and widening reminders, replacing the immediate per-document approval email and the manual "send signing notifications" action
- Deterministic vendor adoption in tracker mapping is gated behind a confidence/trust bar; lower-confidence rows are reused as hints and re-confirmed by an independent agent, and attributions must cite concrete evidence

### Fixed

- Tracker-pattern attribution is kept consistent with the vendor link: a first-party reclassification clears the stale org vendor link, and FIRST_PARTY rows are excluded from the enrichment requeue

## [0.212.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- OIDC authentication now opens a child session when assuming an organization

### Fixed

- OIDC organization access errors now return a 404 instead of an internal error

## [0.211.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Exit codes

## [0.211.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Missing OS exit code on error

## [0.211.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Document delete confirmation dialog in the console

### Changed

- Error responses during a server panic are now always serialized as JSON
- Enrichment tracking unified with outcome-based status; enrichment state, attempts, and run outcome now recorded per field

### Fixed

- Enrichment re-arm and migration backfill gaps corrected
- Google Workspace access review source-name resolution no longer loops on 403 responses

## [0.210.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Electronic signature on employee document signings: the signed PDF is generated and an esign record is created and accepted (capturing signer IP and user agent), mirroring the document approval flow; consent wording is now a single backend source of truth rendered consistently across the signing, approval, and NDA pages
- Structured authorization decision logging: every authorizer evaluation (allow, deny, no_match, assumption error) emits a decision line with policy id and reason using opaque ids

### Changed

- Access review campaign sources reworked: sources are first-class with a per-campaign snapshot (name, connector) taken at start time, fetch attempts recorded as an append-only log, the unused source category removed, and the deleted-source badge dropped from the campaign detail
- Access review roles render as up to three badges with a "+X more" popover instead of one long comma-separated string

### Fixed

- Access review connection status now probes all providers (static, dynamic, and custom) so bad API keys and expired OAuth tokens no longer show as Connected
- Cursor access review driver marks an account inactive when either `isRemoved` or role `removed` is set, fixing accounts reported active despite removal
- MCP profile output no longer fails schema validation when a profile has no additional email addresses

## [0.209.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Common third-party enricher worker that fills the global catalog (legal name, headquarters, canonical website, compliance docs, certifications, logo, owned domains) with per-field provenance and confidence thresholds; opt-in, no-ops without an agent provider
- Tracker mapping and common-pattern enrichment agents can now open pages with a read-only headless browser (gated on Chrome endpoint) to read setters from cookie-database and policy pages
- Discovery and persistence of common third-party owned domains, used to re-resolve previously unmapped tracker patterns
- `Cache-Control` and `ETag` on `/api/files/v1/static` brand assets; startup validation of required assets

### Changed

- Tracker enrichment agent now restates source-page descriptions in its own words rather than copying them verbatim
- Common third-party enrichment agents run in parallel after website resolution; prompts rewritten in role/task/instructions XML style with a calibrated confidence rubric
- Oversized logo responses are rejected instead of truncated; ownership substring matching tightened with a length-ratio guard; per-agent error text sanitized and bounded before persistence

### Fixed

- Activate-login path
- `find_links_matching` browser tool double-encoded its pattern, starving any agent using it
- Worker confidence threshold of `0` no longer dropped by Helm falsy-numeric truthiness

## [0.208.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Trust center file creation in console
- S3 filename header escaping

## [0.208.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `active` status field on access entries
- Import action for catalog vendors in trackers; `importThirdPartyFromCommon`
  mutation to pull a catalog vendor into an org
- Catalog vendors surfaced in tracker policy documents
- File download URLs for console file fields

### Changed

- Trust and MCP connector logos now use the File type
- Third parties deduplicated by name; unique index enforced per org
- Tracker mapping no longer auto-creates org third parties; explicit import required
- Tracker row and category select restyled; move-to-category confirm dialog removed
- Tracker mapping restored to link existing patterns; "create only" mode removed
- Document major version publishing requires explicit `approver_ids`
- References updated to probo.com

### Removed

- Third-party disambiguation agent and automatic matching removed

### Fixed

- DNS TXT lookup retried over TCP on truncated UDP response

## [0.207.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Neon access-review connector (organization members via Neon API, API-key auth)
- Render access-review connector (workspace members, API-key + Workspace ID)
- Qovery access-review connector (organization members, configurable `Token` Authorization scheme)
- API-key connector providers can now declare a custom Authorization token scheme (defaults to `Bearer`)
- `regulationSource` (`DETECTED`/`DEFAULT`) on cookie consent records, with GDPR/OPT_IN applied as the safe default when geolocation does not resolve a known regulation
- `--keyword` scoping on the banner tracker-reset operator path: rebuilds only patterns whose pattern or display name contains the substring
- `parent_third_party_id` foreign key on third parties for arbitrary sub-third-party nesting depth; `level` (int, 1+) replaces the `firstLevel` boolean

### Changed

- Tracker-mapping agent ignores cookie-database/consent-directory operators (Cookipedia, cookiedatabase.org, CookieServe, …) as vendor attributions; CMP own-cookie attributions (OneTrust, Cookiebot, …) still survive
- Tracker-mapping agent ignores own-domain tracker attributions (patterns embedding the scanned site's own eTLD+1) with a deterministic backstop
- Relinking a common tracker pattern to a different third party now updates the confidence on linked org patterns
- Rename console label "Detected Count" to "Distinct Trackers Detected"
- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern reenrich` now accepts catalog-wide filters with no selection anchor (e.g. `--without-description` re-enriches every pattern lacking a description)

### Fixed

- Null out stale `initiator_url`/`initiator_domain` rows on `detected_trackers` that point at the @probo/cookie-banner bundle, so genuine third-party initiators repopulate on next detection
- Cookie-database denylist now matches domain and URL forms (e.g. `cookiedatabase.org`, `https://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/list`), not just bare brand names

### Removed

- `createThirdPartyThirdPartyMapping` and `deleteThirdPartyThirdPartyMapping` mutations and MCP tools; create a child third party by passing `parentThirdPartyId` on `createThirdParty`

## [0.206.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- `RiskAssessmentBoundary` first-class entity to group nodes within a risk assessment scope, with self-nesting parent boundary, scope-membership validation, nested-subgraph Mermaid rendering, and dedicated IAM actions
- `regenerateCookieBannerTrackerPolicy` mutation/MCP tool to re-trigger tracker policy generation on a banner that already has a published version, gated by a dedicated `regenerate-policy` action
- Better Stack access-review connector (Uptime API team members + pending invitations)
- SigNoz access-review connector (organization members, region/tenant or self-hosted base URL)
- `commonTrackerPatternId` field on `TrackerPattern` to indicate whether a pattern is linked to the global common-tracker catalog
- Files API: public endpoint `GET /api/files/v1/public/{fileID}` (unauthenticated, public files only) and private endpoint `GET /api/files/v1/{fileID}` (session/API key/OAuth2, `core:file:get` enforced); IAM and not-found errors both return 404
- Static brand assets served via `/api/files/v1/static` instead of S3

### Changed

- Connector provider infos promoted from `Organization.connectorProviderInfos` to a root-level `accessReviewDrivers` query, listable by any authenticated identity
- Tracker-mapping, common-pattern enrichment, and third-party disambiguation agents each get their own config (own timeout, own max-turns, own optional provider slot, with fallback to the tracker-mapping slot when unset)
- Console: tracker pages now surface common-tracker/third-party links with a "common" badge and updated pattern properties display

### Fixed

- Cookie tracker pattern analysis: removed unused sync re-enrich path and tightened reset/remap scoping

### Removed

- `ActionFileDownloadUrl` (replaced by `ActionFileGet`) and the standalone `pkg/filesign` package (folded into `file.Service`)

## [0.205.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- `submitAgentRunApproval` mutation to merge human approval decisions into an interrupted agent run and resume it
- Suspendable agent-tool subtrees: nested agent runs can now checkpoint and restore across multi-level tool calls

### Changed

- Agent-run worker no longer relies on leases and heartbeats: a graceful suspend returns the run to `PENDING`, an approval interruption parks it in `AWAITING_APPROVAL`, and crashed runs are left `RUNNING` for manual recovery
- AWS credentials now resolve through the full standard AWS SDK credential chain

### Fixed

- Auditors can now read the organization context and see the Context page in the console
- NDA upload now correctly sets the organization ID
- Logo updates no longer wipe unspecified fields on partial update
- Cookie tracker pattern analysis now splits on `:` and `.` so UUID-bearing keys collapse to a single template

### Added

- Add measure ↔ third-party many-to-many link with tabs on both detail pages
- Add self-referential third-party relations with a `first_level` filter on the third-party list

### Fixed

- Fix signature count mismatch between the document version badge and the signatures tab — both now filter by `activeContract: true` and `state: ACTIVE`, so deactivated signers and ended-contract signers are consistently excluded
- Fix MCP server resolvers after the signature filter and authorization changes

## [0.191.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Add a tracker pattern detail page in the console with a properties section and a list of detected tracker resources

### Fixed

- Strip empty ProseMirror text nodes from third-party list documents (and migrate existing `document_versions.content` to drop them) so Tiptap renders them instead of erroring with "Empty text nodes are not allowed"
- Tailor signature certificate email copy for document approvals — store the per-signature email subject on creation so the certificate worker uses "Your approved <Title> - Certificate of Completion" for approvals and the existing default for other flows
- Return a CONFLICT error instead of an opaque Internal error when deleting a membership profile that is still referenced as owner, approver, or assignee, by detecting the Postgres foreign-key violation in the coredata Delete path
- Always instantiate the coredata `CookieCategoryFilter` in the cookie banner queries to avoid nil-pointer risks

## [0.190.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Fix the snapshot-cleanup migration to delete from `processing_activity_third_parties` (the table was renamed from `processing_activity_vendors` in 0.189.0), so the migration runs on databases upgraded past the rename

## [0.190.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Add a hierarchical risk assessment system with Risk Assessment, Scope, Node (ENTITY / BOUNDARY / ASSET / DATA), Process, Threat, and Risk Scenario entities, and render a Mermaid data-flow diagram per scope (nodes typed by shape, threats attached as dashed edges)
- Add 13 access-review connector providers (with PKCE, token-body extras, and `AuthURL` templating support in the OAuth2 driver), and wire them through the review engine, the name worker, and the Helm chart
- Add a tracker mapping worker that resolves detected trackers to third parties using initiator domain extraction (eTLD+1), pattern-glob analysis, and a Firecrawl-backed LLM agent fallback for unmapped patterns
- Add a shared `common_third_parties` / `common_third_party_domains` catalog with slug-based deduplication, allow a single domain to be associated with multiple third parties, and auto-create entries from OCD imports
- Introduce the `proboctl` CLI (replaces the standalone `common-third-parties-import` and `common-tracker-patterns-import` commands as `proboctl seed ...`), with `data.json` embedded in the binary

### Changed

- Move the Firecrawl API key from the top-level config into `Agents.Tools`, hardcode the Firecrawl API endpoint (drop `FIRECRAWL_ENDPOINT`), and replace the SearXNG search backend with Firecrawl
- Split cookie names on both `_` and `-` separators so cookies like `__Secure-1PSID` no longer collapse into a bogus `___*` heuristic pattern

### Fixed

- Filter SCIM-deactivated (INACTIVE) people from signature request recipient lists in both the multi-select dialog and the document signatures page

### Removed

- Remove the deprecated snapshot system (the register/document model fully replaces it)
- Remove backend inactive-profile validation that incorrectly rejected newly-created users on first login

## [0.189.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Rename `vendor` to `third party` across the API surface (GraphQL, MCP), database schema (migration), webhook event types (`vendor:*` → `third_party:*`), snapshot type (`VENDORS` → `THIRD_PARTIES`), and console / trust URL paths (breaking)
- Log `identity_id` on every authenticated request (cookie session, API key, OAuth2 access token) so operators can correlate a request back to its user and credential

## [0.188.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Derive cookie consent mode dynamically from the visitor's country and applicable regulation at consent-recording time; the `consent_mode` column is dropped from `cookie_banners` and persisted on `cookie_consent_records` instead, defaulting to `OPT_OUT` when no regulation matches (breaking)
- Capture `X-SDK-Version` via middleware and include it as `sdk_version` on all cookie banner request logs
- Use distinct badge colors per resource type and tracker type instead of only highlighting scripts

### Fixed

- Eliminate deadlocks when concurrent `ReportDetectedTrackers` calls update `tracker_patterns.last_matched_at` by replacing per-row updates with a single bulk update
- Stop generating bare `*` tracker patterns from separator-less cookie names; such names are kept as individual exact-match patterns for triage

### Removed

- Drop the legacy `cookies` and `cookie_patterns` tables (superseded by `tracker_patterns` and `detected_trackers`)

## [0.187.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Add a shared `common_third_parties` reference catalog, seeded from `packages/vendors/data.json` via a one-shot `common-third-parties-import` CLI, and back the `CreateVendorDialog` autocomplete with a new `commonThirdParties(name)` GraphQL query (server-side `ILIKE` search) instead of shipping the full vendor JSON bundle to the browser
- Self-host vendor logos in S3: at import time, fetch each site's HTML and pick the best icon (SVG, `apple-touch-icon`, large PNG, `msapplication-TileImage`) via the new `pkg/webinspect` package, then serve through the existing `/api/files/v1/{id}` endpoint instead of calling Google's favicon service per page load

### Changed

- Sanitize MCP error responses so internal details (stack traces, wrapped errors) are no longer leaked to clients

### Fixed

- Return a clean not-found error instead of a 500 when a membership lookup misses
- Upgrade `mermaid` to 11.15.0 to address GHSA-6m6c-36f7-fhxh (Gantt infinite-loop DoS), GHSA-xcj9-5m2h-648r and GHSA-87f9-hvmw-gh4p (CSS injection via `classDef`/configuration), and GHSA-ghcm-xqfw-q4vr (HTML injection via `classDef` in state diagrams)

## [0.186.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Fix wrong entity types in `tracker_patterns` and `detected_trackers` GIDs: rows carried entity types of removed `CookiePatternEntityType` / `CookieEntityType` instead of `TrackerPatternEntityType` / `DetectedTrackerEntityType`

## [0.186.0] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Update kit package

## [0.185.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Add `TrackerResource` entity for detected scripts, iframes, images, beacons, fonts, fetches, media, and service workers, with full GraphQL, MCP, CLI, and frontend surface (list, view, create, update, delete, move-to-category); new "Resources" page under the cookie banner configuration tab
- Add `GLOB` match type for tracker patterns supporting prefix, suffix, and sandwich patterns (e.g. `ph_phc_*_posthog`), with duration-aware merging so trackers with materially different lifetimes are no longer collapsed into a single pattern
- Detect HTTP-header cookies via the Chromium `CookieStore` change event and expose a new `http` cookie source
- Add tracker-type filter and color-coded badges on the trackers page for quick visual scanning across Cookie / localStorage / sessionStorage / IndexedDB / Cache Storage
- Capture script initiator URL on detected trackers to enable per-vendor attribution for cookies and storage writes (column captured now, surfaced later)

### Changed

- Replace `PREFIX` tracker pattern match type with `GLOB` across GraphQL, MCP, and the frontend; existing `PREFIX` rows are migrated to `GLOB` with a trailing `*` (breaking)
- Make tracker pattern `displayName` read-only across GraphQL, MCP, and the frontend — it is now derived from pattern + match type (breaking)
- Pattern analysis worker now detects UUID-like, hash-like, and long numeric tokens as variable parts even from a single observation, so site-specific identifiers no longer get treated as static text
- Rename the cookie banner "Detection" page to "Trackers" and drop the `SCRIPT` / `IFRAME` tracker types (replaced by `TrackerResource`) (breaking)
- Agent runs now treat ctx cancellation as a graceful suspend signal: supervisor shutdown maps to run ctx cancellation, and the previous `WithStopSignal` API is removed (breaking for in-process callers)

### Fixed

- Fix empty country code being persisted on cookie consent records when IP geolocation returns no matching CIDR block
- Fix SQL corruption (HTTP 500 on `/report`) in `FindMatchingPattern` caused by `fmt.Sprintf` interpreting `%` characters in the LIKE escape clause
- Use `@deleteEdge` on the access review campaign delete mutation so the cached connection no longer surfaces a missing-data error when reopening the access reviews tab

## [0.184.2] - 2026-05-08

### Security

- Upgrade go to 1.26.3

## [0.184.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Microsoft 365 access review driver now fetches only internal members from Microsoft Graph (`$filter=userType eq 'Member'`), so guest (B2B) accounts are no longer pulled into access review
- SCIM settings page now hides the other IdP connector card once a bridge is connected; both remain listed when nothing is configured

### Fixed

- Fix cookie banner opt-out button opening the preference panel instead of performing a one-click reject in OPT_OUT regulations

## [0.184.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Allow editing approvers inline on SOA generated documents from the Statement of Applicability detail page (visible after first publish)

### Fixed

- Fix Microsoft 365 SCIM bridge: register the `MICROSOFT_365` connector provider, scope each Identity Provider card to its own bridge type so connecting one provider no longer marks others as connected, and filter Microsoft Graph users to home-tenant members (skip B2B guests)
- Fix cookie banner REST config endpoint compatibility for SDK versions ≤ 0.2.0
- Fix geolocation IP-to-country block imports

## [0.183.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Add IP-to-country geolocation service with shadow-table swap import and CIDR-based lookups
- Detect the visitor's privacy regulation (GDPR, UK GDPR, FADP, CCPA, PIPEDA, LGPD, LFPDPPP, POPIA, PDPA, PIPL, PIPA, APPI, DPDP, PDPL) on the cookie banner config endpoint and adapt the banner UI and texts accordingly (opt-out notice for CCPA, simple notice when no regulation applies)
- Store regulation and country code on cookie consent records and expose both across GraphQL, MCP, CLI, and n8n
- Allow deleting access review campaigns from the UI (DRAFT or CANCELLED only, gated on `core:access-review-campaign:delete`)
- Support Google Cloud Identity in the SCIM bridge (in addition to Google Workspace)

### Changed

- Access review campaigns no longer transition to `FAILED` when individual sources fail to fetch; the failure stays surfaced on the source fetch (status + last error) and reviewers can proceed on the sources that succeeded (breaking: removed `FAILED` from `AccessReviewCampaignStatus`)
- Allow editing metadata (title, document type, classification) on generated document versions; only content edits remain rejected

### Fixed

- Fix cookie banner docs link to `www.getprobo.com/docs`

## [0.182.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Add Microsoft 365 SCIM bridge and access review driver

### Removed

- Remove legacy `cookie_patterns` GraphQL schema, MCP tools, CLI commands, and n8n operations
